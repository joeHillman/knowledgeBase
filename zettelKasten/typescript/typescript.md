## What is TypeScript

## Typescript Primitives
[[../javascript-primitives]]
* String, number, boolean, null, undefined are recognized by Typescript.
* TypeScript Type Inference
* * Assumes expected type of variable would match what is initially assigned.
* * `let first = 'Anders'; first = 1234 // type number is not assignable to type string`
* * Alternatively you could rely on typescript any `let first; first = 'Anders'; first = 1234`
* * Without an initial value assigned, TS will assume it's of any type.
* Shape of an object `let firstName = 'Joe'; console.log(firstName.toUppercase())`
* * TS knows you want `toUpperCase()` because it knows what properties that type contains.
* Type Annotations are supported `let first: string; first = 'Anders'; first = 1234`
* * First is annotated as a string and will ensure only a string gets assigned here.
