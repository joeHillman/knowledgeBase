## What is Typescript
TypeScript is JavaScript's runtime with a compile-time type checker.

## What does this mean?
Typescript is a static type checker for Javascript and is a superset of Javascript.
This means that TypeScript being a static type checker, will check the program before errors prior to execution.
Where TypeScript is a superset of Javascript, legal Javascript syntax is legal TypeScript.

One key difference is that TypeScript is a typed superset unlike Javascript which is untyped.

Typescript will preserve the Javascript runtime and will erase any of the typescript annotation when the compiler has completed checking the program.

## In Summary
Remember that, TypeScript is JavaScript's runtime with a compile-time type checker :[[./typeChecking]].
