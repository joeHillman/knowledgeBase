# ./javascript-non-primitives
* Javascript values that are not primitives are objects.
* Objects group related code.

## Data types

Objects - Group related data and code. ({})
Functions - Used to refer to code. Functions are also considered objects, also considered values.

Everything else that is not a primitive is an object, arrays, dates, expressions, all objects...
Objects allow us to make and update our own values and a new one is created each time.
Objects cannot be destroyed, though if unreachable for a time, they will be garbage collected by JS.
* Unless you are analyzing performance, you will not need to worry about garbage collection.
