Primitives can only contain a single thing, unlike objects which can store collections and more complex structures. You cannot create, change, nor destroy primitives.

## Undefined = undefined - unassigned values
* Only ever returns a value of undefined
* Unintentionally missing value
* Will break your program!

## Null = null typically used as developer is aware it's not assigned anything
* Undefined better tempered sister
* Masquerades as an object due to underlying bug in language
* Intentionally missing value but only by convention not by spec

## Boolean = true/false values usually used as an expression that resolves to a boolean
* Has a type of boolean
* Returns value of true or false, nothing else

## Number - whole or decimal/floating values, integers limited by +-(2 sup53 -1)
* Type of number
* Uses floating point math with limited precision
* BigInt handles finer precision
* There's only a single number for a value, there aren't multiple 1's.
* Nan generally means there's invalid math in the equation
* Infinity, -Inifinity, and -0 can also mean there's issues in your code.
  
## BigInt - newi-ish integers numbers of arbitary length
* Handles large integers with precision.
* Good for precision with Math.

## String - a piece of text, wrapped in either single or double quotes
* Series of characters
* Envision like numbers, each is a unique value
* Are not objects tho share familiar methods

## Symbol - unique identifier, performs rituals, hides secrets
* Hide away information and control which parts of a code can access it

## Assignment Operator
* left side must be a "wire" or variable
* right side must be an expression [[./javscript-expressions]]
* * Literals are things we literally down the values that they result $
* * * String Literal = "literal" // Object Literal = {one: 1, two: 2}
