# Electrical System in the Home
## Basics
Electricity flows from the poles out side to the service entrance in the home. It then connects to the panel where it serves the branch circuits that power the home. It runs in a continous loop thruout the house, powering switches, receptacles, and in turn the devices connected to them. It travels to the components via the hot wire and returns to the panel via the neutral wire. In most cases you should have a ground wire present if it is updated wiring.

## Panel
The panel houses the various circuit breakers. They are staggered and only breakers that service large appliances will have a need for both legs coming in from the street. **Note**: This may not be obvious from the appearance of the breakers from the front side of the panel.
