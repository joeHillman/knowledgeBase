# ./github-workflows

Workflows underpin Github actions. [[./github-actions]]
A workflow is
* a configurable automated process
* YAML based
* can be triggered by
* * an event in the repo
* * manually
* * at a defined schedule
* must be defined in .github/workflows directory
* can be one of multiple workflows

Workflows require a few things...
* One or more events that will trigger it [[./github-events]]
* One or more jobs, each executing on a runner machine running a series of one or more steps [[./github-jobs]]
* each step can either run a defined script or an action
